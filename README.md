# Selectionsort
An easy and template based implementation of selectionsort

### How to use ###
Include the .hpp in your project and import it<br/>
Once you have created a class object, there is three easy steps to do.<br/>
   a) use loadVector() to load the internal vector with the values you want to sort<br/>
   b) sort() To sort the internal vector<br/>
   c) getVector() to get the sorted values<br/>

If there is any issue, open up a ticket and I will take a look at it
